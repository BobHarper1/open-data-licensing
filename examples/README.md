# ODRS Vocabulary Examples

This directory contains a number of examples of how the ODRS vocabulary can be used to publish a range of rights statements in a variety of formats.

The [Publisher Guide](https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/publisher-guide.md) contains a detailed walk through of publishing rights statements and is a good place to start for new users.

This directory includes complete copies of the examples from the publisher guide, along with some additional examples that cover other uses

## List of Examples
